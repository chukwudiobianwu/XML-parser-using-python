-----
(1) process_cal2.py submitted and named appropriately; runs
without errors or warnings.

- Yes, the submitted file is correct, and the code
  runs successfully without errors or warnings.

-----
(2) Tests passed (and further comments)

- All tests passed. Great work.

-----
(3) Code formatting and structure:

Positive aspects:

- Good solution that makes use of relevant Python collections and modules.

- Good formatting and structure of the code that facilitates reading
  and understanding.

- Good naming conventions for functions and variables.

- Good attempt at documenting the code using comments to describe
  important aspects of the solution.

- Reasonable attempt at code segmentation (i.e., appropriate function
  creation and use). Consider dividing large functions into various
  smaller functions with a smaller scope and a well-defined purpose.

Improvement opportunities:

- Instead of having large functions, it is a good practice to divide
  your program into small pieces of functionality defined in
  well-defined functions. Functions should have a unique intention and a
  very clear scope. This facilitates the re-usability and maintainability
  of your code.

- It is always a good idea to minimize the length of your main()
  function to facilitate the re-usability of your code. A large or
  considerably big main() function might indicate that some portions of
  code in the function might placed in independent functions, which
  might potentially reused in the future. 

- To facilitate and accelerate reading Python code, it is recommended 
  to describe\document the each function in terms of their arguments (e.g., types, optional)
  and return (e.g., type).
